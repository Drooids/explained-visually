# Using Interactivity & Simulation for explanation

# Explained Visually

Using visualization and simulation to explain concepts intuitively.

An experiment in visual learning.

There are things easier to show then to describe.

"The power to understand and predict the quantities of the world should not be restricted to those with a freakish knack for manipulating abstract symbols." - Bret Victor

Facilitate an intuitive understanding of concepts.

So many Java based interactive learning tools are now fading from the internet because Java isn't an open platform. The same is happening to Flash applications. JavaScript is a web standard so applications built with it will likely stay available for much longer.

How visualization and simulation can be used to help teach concepts.

Explained Visually - An exploration in using visualization to explain concepts and ideas instead of data. We'll survey existing works and techniques and explore the future of visual explanations.
