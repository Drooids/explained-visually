+ make it more specific (mention SF and NY)
+ make a connection to the geometric
+ when you flipped it across, that make it clearer.
+ break it down, breaking time into space
+ what all can be done with the penny image and why eigen vectors help with that.
+ draw your own thing and transform
+ start specific sf, ny
+ light projected, something really specific and concrete
+ how are these two things using the same exact eigen vector thing.
+ what concept is being explained
+ two specific examples
+ go point by point, see it happen
+ it's probably more abstract then you think it is
+ the idea that the whole is the sum of its parts (kind of a big idea)
+ people don't normally think of images
+ i want to see all the different types of transformations
+ what are the eigen vectors of all these different things
+ i want to see the eigen values.
