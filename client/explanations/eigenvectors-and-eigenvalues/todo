NEW
on the markov matrix thing, use d3.format to make sure that nubmers like 0.9 are 0.90
label the eigenspaces
on the third plot, make the eigenvalues matched correctly




HARD
add another plot of the eigen vectors for state transition.
do the button thing in the first plot

DONE
move the matrix A up at the top to the left. show what v is above the matrix.
color matrix columns along basis.
change v_0 to v and v_1 to Av in all the intro ones
light up the additional dots in the double eigenspace plot
on bacteria plot, legend saying "adult" with yellow circle and children with dark circle
added lewis to byline
write out what the transition percentages are
put on the plots what the _eigenvalues_ are

PASS

hide the second eigenspace in the second plot
collapse both eigen plots into one
